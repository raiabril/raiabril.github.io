![Wine](https://dl.winehq.org/share/images/winehq_logo_glass.png)

`Wine` is a compatibility layer to run `Windows` applications in `POSIX` systems like `Linux`.

One great example is the possibility to create `.exe` files using `Python`.

> Please note that in the recent versions of Windows such as Windows 11, Microsoft is forcing you to sign the `.exe` files in order to be able to run them.

## Install wine in your machine

It can be installed with your package manager.

```console
sudo apt-get install wine
```

Note that it's necessary to have x86 arch also enabled, so maybe you have to run this:

```console
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine32
```

## Install Python

To install `Python` you must download the version that you want to run. In this case we are using `2.7`

![Download-python-msi](/assets/img/posts/wine-python-download.png)

```console
sudo wine msiexec /i /home/kali/Downloads/python-2.7.18.msi
```

It will be installed in `/root/.wine/drive_c/Python27`

## Install Pip dependencies

Once it is installed, you would see that you have the `/root/.wine/` folder. Let's [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

```console
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
sudo wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/python.exe get-pip.py
sudo wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/python.exe -m pip help
```

To install dependencies and use in the executable,

```console
sudo wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/python.exe -m pip install <dependency>
```

## Build the executable

To compile the executable

```console
sudo wine /root/.wine/drive_c/Python27/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe --onefile --noconsole <python_file.py>
```

> Python 2.7 reached end of its life on January 1st, 2020. Please upgrade your Python!!

## Obfuscate and Windows Defender

In the recent versions of Windows your `.exe` file will be identified by Windows Defender. So long I wasn't able to avoid this using alternative packages to `pyinstaller` or using obfuscation. Let me know if there is some workaround to signing the files!
