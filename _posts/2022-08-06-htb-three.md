## Scanning and enumeration

Now it's time to start the active scanning.

As always, we define our TARGET and hosts file of our machine to facilitate the process.

```console
TARGET=10.129.137.21
echo "10.129.137.21 three.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

We launch a single `TCMP` probe to check ping.

```console
ping -c 1 $TARGET		# => Ping is working
```

### NMAP

To scan the `target` to find open ports and possible vulnerabilities we use `nmap`.

First, simple `TCP` scan without `DNS` resolution and ping discovery, to all the ports and with the version detection.

```console
nmap -n -Pn -sV -p- $TARGET -vvv -oG allPorts
```

```console
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON  VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We don't find important vulnerabilities using exploit-db. For the SSH service we could use user enumeration but we have no password.

### Web in port 80

We examine the website and we find the domain for the email. We include this domain in our `/etc/hosts`.

```console
echo "10.129.137.21 thetroppers.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Then we launch `ffuf` to discover directories and subdomains. For the directories.

```console
ffuf -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -fc=404 -u http://thetoppers.htb/FUZZ
```

Nothing important shows here, just the expected `images`.

Now we check the subdomains using the `Host` header.

```console
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web/Sudmo
```
## Gaining access
