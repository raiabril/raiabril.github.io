## Scanning and enumeration

Now it's time to start the active scanning.

As always, we define our TARGET and hosts file of our machine to facilitate the process.

```console
TARGET=10.129.137.21
echo "10.129.137.21 three.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

We launch a single `TCMP` probe to check ping.

```console
ping -c 1 $TARGET		# => Ping is working
```

### NMAP

To scan the `target` to find open ports and possible vulnerabilities we use `nmap`.

First, simple `TCP` scan without `DNS` resolution and ping discovery, to all the ports and with the version detection.

```console
nmap -n -Pn -sV -p- $TARGET -vvv -oG allPorts
```
