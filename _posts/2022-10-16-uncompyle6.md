[uncompyle6](https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6/) translates Python bytecode back into equivalent Python source code.

It enables the possibility to create `.py` files using the compiled version `.pyc`.


## Install uncompyle6

It can be installed with your package manager.

```console
sudo pip install uncompyle6
```


## Decompile file

We just need to run the package to see it in action.

```console
uncompyle6 get_flag.cpython-38.pyc -o get_flag.py
```
